Sample Programming in Dafny

This repository consists of sample programs from the course overheads for CS245 Fall 2018
written in Dafny with the purpose of demonstrating the basics for program verification.

Experiment and have fun with it!

Dafny can be downloaded for your programming environment (look up how)
or you can paste the code in their online environment https://rise4fun.com/dafny 
There are tutorials somewhere online... Find them if you are interested.

Special thanks to Microsoft for making Dafny and to Rylo Ashmore introducing me to this.
It really is like programming with someone constantly hovering over your shoulder...
PLEASE JUST LET ME COMPILE THIS ONE THING!!! ASFDSGdjfhjklgjm'l!
